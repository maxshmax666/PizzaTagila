# Architecture Docs Agent Guide
Scope: `/docs/architecture`.

- Keep sections concise (prefer bullet lists and short paragraphs under ~8 lines).
- Focus on entry points (`src/index.ts`, `src/core`, `src/design/tokens.ts`, `src/server/logger.ts`, `src/components`) and how they connect.
- Always include the npm commands newcomers must run (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:coverage`).
- Link back to `README.md` and `docs/onboarding/README.md` instead of duplicating lengthy instructions.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when architecture docs change.
