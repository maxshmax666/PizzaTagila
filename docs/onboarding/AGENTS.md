# Onboarding Docs Agent Guide
Scope: `/docs/onboarding`.

- Keep guidance short and action-focused: highlight entry points (`src/index.ts`, `src/core`, `src/design/tokens.ts`) and the main commands newcomers must run.
- Prefer bullet lists and numbered steps over prose; keep sections under ~8 lines.
- Link back to `README.md` and `docs/UI_SPEC.md` instead of duplicating details.
- When adding code snippets, ensure they run with `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, or `npm run test:coverage`.
