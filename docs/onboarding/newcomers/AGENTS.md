# Newcomer Guide Agent
Scope: `/docs/onboarding/newcomers`.

- Keep guidance action-focused: bullet lists, no sections longer than ~8 lines.
- Always point to entry files (`src/index.ts`, `src/core`, `src/design/tokens.ts`) and the facade tests in `src/index.test.ts`.
- Include the npm commands newcomers must run (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:coverage`).
- Link back to `README.md`, `docs/onboarding/README.md`, and `docs/UI_SPEC.md` instead of repeating full details.
